This project is under construction.

Currectly available:
- Montecarlo pricing of vanilla European calls and up-and-out barrier call option. File: "option_pricing_montecarlo.cpp".
- Analytic formulae for vanilla European calls and up-and-out barrier call option. Functions in "options_lib.py".
- File "price_analysis.py" is useful to plot the histograms of the Montecarlo simulation results and compare with the analytic price.
- File "plot_options_price.py" plots European call and up-and-out barrier call option prices as a function of different parameters.
